# IPL-season-prediction
Prediction of Indian Premier League season statistics like season winner, orange cap winner (batsman scoring most number of runs) , purple cap winner (bowler taking most number of wickets) etc by running every match simulation using ball-to-ball predictions. Used a [Fitness proportionate selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_proportionate_selection) probabilistic model (roulette wheel selection) over various factors like batsman vs bowler statistics, batsman vs venue statistics, batsman vs innings statistics to predict the outcome of each ball.
